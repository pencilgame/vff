    	Wildness is essential to the well-being of the whole forest community. Rotting logs, wind-felled trees, standing snags, large-diameter legacy trees—all are  part of a healthy forest.

    	People can work in and harvest from the forest in ways that encourage its health and wildness—mutually beneficial relationship at its best.

    	Clean water. Clean air. Beauty. Firewood. Wildlife habitat. Peace and solitude. Timber. Maple syrup. Soul restoration. Carbon sequestration. Just  a  few of the gifts of a healthy, rewilding forest.

<h1>Welcome to Vermont Family Forests</h1>
  <p>Everything our little organization does begins and ends with forest health. Whether we͛re meeting with a landowner to help them develop  a forest conservation plan, or hosting a workshop on light-on-the-land forestry, or stoking the fires of engagement and conversation with pizzas baked in our wood-fired earth oven, we͛re guided by the intention to grow the health and wholeness of the forest community.</p>
